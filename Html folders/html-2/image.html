    <p>The nature is the wonderfull in the world, it includes all the animals, birds, trees and lakes .
         The nature also has the most important things like villeges, towns and cities.
         Nature is everything around us that is not made by humans. It includes the air we breathe, the water we drink, the trees, plants, animals, mountains, rivers, seas, and even the sky. Nature gives us beauty, peace, and life.
          Trees clean the air and give us oxygen. Rivers and rains give us water to drink and grow food. Animals and birds help keep the environment balanced. Nature changes with seasons—spring brings flowers, summer gives warmth, autumn shows colorful leaves, and winter brings cold and snow. 
          Nature is also full of wonder—like sunsets, rainbows, stars, and wildlife. It is important to take care of nature because we depend on it for everything. If we protect it, it will protect us in return.
